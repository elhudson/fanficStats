## October 20, 2023

Got my feet wet with some test data yesterday. I used about 400 Our Flag Means Death fics, as it's a fairly active fandom not overwhelming in size, to get a sense of what the typical hits/kudos/ratio thereof distribution is. Two things stood out:

1. The top five fics by kudos-- including two big outliers-- were rated Explicit (i.e., pornographic)-- and not vanilla porn, either! Check out the tags on the second one:

>Not exactly what I'd call vanilla! And yet, this garnered almost 40,000 views and upwards of 900 likes! (which AO3 calls 'kudos'; as a classicist in a past life, this has always delighted me.) That said: this is almost certainly a compilation of smaller stories rather than one large one, given that it has 26 chapters and the title *OFMD Kinktober 2022*-- Kinktober being an erotic writing challenge that often makes its way into fan fiction communities as well. One reason this work might be rated so highly compared to its fellows: people only come to it for one chapter, read that, leave a kudos, and then depart? When we're talking about erotic fiction, that probably implies that most people are here for one of the number of niche kinks listed in the tags-- that is, if it's true, which it may not be. Another question for the pile of questions this project might illuminate: when people read erotic fanfiction, do they tend to select material based on characters and/or fandom of interest, or based on sexual factors? Obviously there's some overlap there-- someone who's very into masochism (emotional and physical) might be more likely than average to read a lot of Spike x Buffy fanfic, but there's also a good chance they're in the fandom to begin with, rather than being an unaffiliated party who just uses AO3 as an erotica archive. My mentor also pointed out the interesting potential dynamic of niche pornography having a high likes/hits ratio (a metric I'm tentatively calling an approval score), because in effect the only people who encounter it are people who are seeking it out, and what you see is typically what you get as far as uncommon kinks go-- even if the writing is subpar, well, no one reads Playboy for the articles.

2. The normal and logarithmic graphs of the approval ratio and hits for the sample both looked very similar,
