Hyperion was a rotting city, and nowhere was more thick with the stench of it’s decay than Oldtown. There was violence in the streets, and behind closed doors. Work was scarce, and the work that did exist was dangerous, poorly paid, and unglamorous. Buildings were poorly constructed, and so was the education given to the children who were unlucky enough to grow up there. The corrupt politicians who lived comfortably in Minerva Heights had already written off Oldtown entirely, and the small allotment of funds that Oldtown was meant to receive had long since depleted into a trickle as it lined the pockets of every official it passed through. AKA - what if the TMA powers existed in the TPP universe.
